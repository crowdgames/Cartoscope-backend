Cairns are piles of rocks left by travelers on hikes. They create a sense of community by reminding travelers that there are others, and also encourages them to keep going onwards. 

In this project we will allow players to take breaks by seeing messages and leave messages behind themselves. 

The primary code for this is within ../public/script/task.ts and ../public/templates/tasks/taskTemplate.html

The 4 projects used to test cairns are at:

 - WFi1yWOGVP0D (No cairns)
 - mlnBUn26g4dg (Soapstones)
 - 8hXmtFjsAdvq (Emojis)
 - MSHa0bROLbFh (Both)
