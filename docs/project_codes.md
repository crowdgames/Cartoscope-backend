Project IDs
-----------

These projectIDs are 2008 Land Loss Lookout data and is what the current cairns project uses:\
["mKSRWYI4E59f", "Z2cg3ppyCsZW", "vOihRaFY2lSS", "ENtBwQQtcK3L", "DQ0RAb6nVgXr", "D1Y4k21Xb9NL"]

These ids are duplicates of the erosion project. When cairn frequency wasn't tied to hitID, these all had different cairn frequencies, but this is no longer necessary.\
("WfpKAneXebT1", "J94tYYPMngNk", "qEEKIgFoFh1m", "dDONGlkBAGUO", "Hzp4vca3LZ4a", "OfohqkweDjEB")

And these are the ids of the original Land Loss Lookout projects:\
["UOYIiFeapnyI","ocioawiaGcjw","KyW6Ti9QUr4I","Srz9arMDwthQ","94yoCWhFkpMk","cXz6ImkmG9k5"]
