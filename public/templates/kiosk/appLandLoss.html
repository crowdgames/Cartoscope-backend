                Protecting the Gulf of Mexico from pollution and wetland destruction requires constant vigilance.
                Often, the best way to keep an eye out is from the air.
                Help <a href="https://www.healthygulf.org/" target="_blank">Healthy Gulf</a> identify patterns by looking at aerial images of the coast.

            <p><b>Request to Participate in Research</b></p>
            <p>We would like to invite you to participate in a web-based online crowdsourcing task. The task is part of a research study whose purpose is to examine how different variations in the presentation of crowdsourced data analysis and mapping can affect accuracy and engagement. You may receive a different interface with different task parameters than other participants. Your interaction data will be recorded and analyzed. This task should take about 20 minutes to complete.</p>
            <p>We are asking you to participate in this study because you are a member of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk--a crowdsourcing platform. <b>You must be fluent in English and be at least 18 years old to</b> <b>participate.</b></p>
            <p><b>The decision to participate in this research project is voluntary.</b> You do not have to participate and you can refuse to participate in the task. Even if you begin the web-based online task, you can stop at any time.</p>
            <p><b>The risks or discomforts to you for taking part in this study are low</b> and are similar to participating in online websites or surveys.</p>
            <p><b>There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study.</b> However, your responses may help us learn more about engagement and performance in citizen science.</p>
            <p><b>For completing the task, you will receive a payment as indicated on your crowdsourcing platform.</b></p>
            <p><b>Your part in this study is anonymized to the researchers. The only individually-identifying data we receive from Mechanical Turk are your unique identifier and your country. We will not save your unique identifier</b> <b>or any other information that could be used to uniquely identify you. We will not ask you any questions that could be used to uniquely identify you.</b> Any reports or publications based on this research will use only anonymized data and will not identify you as being affiliated with this project. Data that are completely stripped of identifiable information may be made available online or shared with other researchers. Your de-identified information could be used for future research without additional informed consent. <b>Your data are also stored on Mechanical Turk's servers, and the data there are subject to the Amazon Mechanical Turk Privacy Notice and Participation Agreement.</b></p>
