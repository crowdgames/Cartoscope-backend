                </em>Title of Project: Crowdsourced Data Analysis and Mapping</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Request to Participate in Research</strong></p>
                <p>We would like to invite you to participate in a web-based online crowdsourcing project. The task is part of a research study whose purpose is to examine how different variations in the presentation of crowdsourced data analysis and mapping can affect accuracy and engagement. You may receive a different interface with different task parameters than other participants. Your interaction data will be recorded and analyzed. You may participate as long as you want.</p>
                <p>We are asking you to participate in this study because of your interest in this citizen science platform. <strong>You must be fluent in English and at least 18 years old to participate in this project.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The decision to participate in this research project is voluntary.</strong> You do not have to participate and you can refuse to participate in the project. Even if you join the project, you can stop at any time.</p>
                <p><strong>You will not be paid for your participation in this study.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The risks or discomforts to you for taking part in this study are low</strong> and are similar to participating in online websites or surveys.</p>
                <p><strong>There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study.</strong> However, your responses may help us learn more about engagement and performance in citizen science.<br />
