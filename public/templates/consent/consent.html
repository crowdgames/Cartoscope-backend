        <p>We would like to invite you to participate in a web-based online crowdsourcing task. The task is part of a research study whose purpose is to examine how different variations in the presentation of crowdsourced data analysis and mapping can affect accuracy and engagement. You may receive a different interface with different task parameters than other participants. Your interaction data will be recorded and analyzed. This task should take about 20 minutes to complete.</p>
        <p>We are asking you to participate in this study because you are a member of Amazon’s Mechanical Turk--a crowdsourcing platform. <b>You must be fluent in English and be at least 18 years old to</b> <b>participate.</b></p>
        <p><b>The decision to participate in this research project is voluntary.</b> You do not have to participate and you can refuse to participate in the task. Even if you begin the web-based online task, you can stop at any time.</p>
        <p><b>The risks or discomforts to you for taking part in this study are low</b> and are similar to participating in online websites or surveys.</p>
        <p><b>There are no direct benefits to you from participating in this study.</b> However, your responses may help us learn more about engagement and performance in citizen science.</p>
        <p><b>For completing the task, you will receive a payment as indicated on your crowdsourcing platform.</b></p>
