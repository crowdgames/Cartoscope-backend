            <p>
                Cartoscope is platform for citizen science through crowdsourced data analysis and mapping.
                By sorting, labelling, and locating images, community members can contribute to a variety of
                mapping projects, such as disaster response. Each memberâ€™s contribution adds up! Organizations
                can create their own projects and invite participants to help assist with their missions.
